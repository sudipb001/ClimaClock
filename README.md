# ClimaClock

This is a small weather and clock app I just created. The climate part's idea was by Dr. Angela Yu. I totally updated the app and UI and added a clock feature for the searched city. It uses UIkit and open weather api. Apart from search, if you click on the small location button, it will show the current location's name, weather and time.

I shall add more features and settings later.
